# Description

This project uses historical weather data from Mars (Sol 1 to Sol 1895, corresponding to Aug 7, 2012 – Feb 27, 2018 on Earth) to build an interactive dashboard for exploring Martian climate conditions. The dashboard helps monitor conditions relevant to active rovers, identify optimal seasons for future rover missions, analyze how weather patterns evolve over time, and assess the environmental conditions new rovers would need to withstand.
