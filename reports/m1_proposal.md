## Section 1 - Motivation and Purpose

Target Audience: Scientists and Engineers at NASA (or other space organization)
Our Role: Data Science Team at NASA (or other space organization)

Problem and Solution:
With rovers already on Mars and new ones being developed, it is vitally important to know the current weather patterns and trends on the Red Planet. With better understanding of weather conditions throughout the year and how measurements like temperature and air pressure have changed over time (from 2012 to 2018) you will be better able to plan for the conditions that new rovers will need to withstand. To address this gap in understanding, we propose building a data visualization app using data collected by the Curiosity Rover, to reveal weather patterns and assist with the planning of future rover launches. Our app will show various measurements over the full time frame as well as typical weather measurements per month.
