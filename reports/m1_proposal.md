## Section 1 - Motivation and Purpose

Target Audience: Scientists and Engineers at NASA (or other space organization)

Our Role: Data Science Team at NASA (or other space organization)

Problem and Solution:
With rovers already on Mars and new ones being developed, it is vitally important to know the current weather patterns and trends on the Red Planet. With better understanding of weather conditions throughout the year and how measurements like temperature and air pressure have changed over time (from 2012 to 2018) and across different solar longitudes, you will be better able to plan for the conditions that new rovers will need to withstand. To address this gap in understanding, we propose building a data visualization app using data collected by rovers currently exploring Mars to reveal weather patterns and assist with the planning of future rover launches. Our app will show various measurements over the full time frame as well as typical weather measurements per month.

## Section 3 - Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

### Usage Scenario

Sophia is an engineer at NASA, who leads the team working on Mars rovers. While she can see the individual weather measurements that come from her team's rover on a daily basis, she wants to understand the weather on Mars at a higher level. To try and answer some of her bigger questions, at the moment, she will copy individual rows from the table of collected data and try to eyeball how the numbers compare to each other on different days. Her goal is to be able to explore all of the daya that her team's rover has collected more holistically to better understand the weather trends over time and if there are any apparent associations between the different measurements.

When Sophia logs on to the MarsCast app, she will be able to see all of the measurements in one place. One of the many visualizations that she now has at her finger tips allows her to see the average temperature and air pressure during each of the 12 months of the Mars year. Since her team is almost ready to launch a new rover, this allows her to identify when they should launch their rover so that it lands on Mars during a time when there is likely to be better conditions.

### User Stories

1. As a rover launch planner, I want to filter temperature and air pressure measurements to be from only certain martian months, so I can determine when will be the best time to plan the launch of our new rover
2. As the lead rover engineer, I want to understand the "current" weather conditions on Mars, to identify whether the weather conditions may have contributed to the abnormal soil readings we just received.
3. As a member of the rover engineering team, I want to explore the relationship between air pressure and daily temperatures to better understand the combined conditions that our new rover will need to be able to withstand
4. As a climate modeller on the NASA rover team, I want to be able to see changes in tempurature and air pressure over time to predict what they may be in the future.
